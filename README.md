# Android Calculator

This is a take a home project given to me by [onXmaps](https://www.onxmaps.com/). The goal was to build a calculator in Kotlin. This is my very first project in Kotlin and the android mobile development environment in general.

## Tech Stack

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)


## Instructions

Create a calculator that can perform 5 operations:

* Addition (complete)
* Subtraction (complete)
* Multiplication (complete)
* Division (complete)
* Remainder (complete)

The calculator will need to take two real numbers as input. It will also need to display the operation that is currently selected (images have been included). The solution will need to be displayed after it has been calculated. If you have extra time, keep and display a history of all operations completed. Some of the Android UI code has been stubbed out for you. Feel free to design the UI however you want.

## Takeaways 

* Styling XML remind me of certain inline styling techniques in React Native and NativeScript. The "@drawable" reminded me of how I source background images in CSS3. 

* I found some type conversion methods from JavaScript, such as contains(), toString(), split(), etc., to work similarly in Kotlin/Java. 

* Numerica data types in Kotlin stood out to me. I'm used to int and float, but short, long, double, etc., are all new to me. It makes you think more critically about what kind of type conversions you need to do. 

* The functional syntax of Kotlin looked simliar to JavaScript ES5 syntax. 

* All in all, this was a fun project that helped me better understand some of the similarities and differences between android and iOS development.
