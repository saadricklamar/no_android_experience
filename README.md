# Android Calculator

This is a take a home project given to me by onXmaps. The goal was to build a calculator in Kotlin. This is my very first project in Kotlin and the android mobile development environment in general.

## Tech Stack

* Android Studio
* Kotlin

## Instructions

Create a calculator that can perform 5 operations:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Remainder (modulus)

The calculator will need to take two real numbers as input. It will also need to display the operation that is currently selected (images have been included). The solution will need to be displayed after it has been calculated. If you have extra time, keep and display a history of all operations completed. Some of the Android UI code has been stubbed out for you. Feel free to design the UI however you want.
