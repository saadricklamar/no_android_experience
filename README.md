# Instructions

Create a calculator that can perform 5 operations:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Remainder (modulus)

The calculator will need to take two real numbers as input. It will
also need to display the operation that is currently selected (images
have been included). The solution will need to be displayed after
it has been calculated. If you have extra time, keep and display a
history of all operations completed. Some of the Android UI code has
been stubbed out for you. Feel free to design the UI however you want.
